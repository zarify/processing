# Genuary 2021
This is the set of my attempts at [Genuary 2021](https://genuary2021.github.io/).
I got further than I thought I was going to, given that it was one prompt a day, and at least one of my kids is still very needy, and I wasn't that happy with how a few of them turned out, but the whole process was thoroughly enjoyable, with the [Twitter generative community](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23genuary2021) sharing some awesome work (quite a few with accompanying code that I'm going to dig into when I have some time).

## Day 1 - Triple Nested Loop

## Day 2 - [Rule](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rule+30) [30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30)

## Day 3 - Make Something Human

## Day 4 - Small areas of symmetry

## Day 5 - Code golf

## Day 6 - Triangle Subdivision

## Day 7 - Generate some rules by hand
This one was such a disappointment. I had a bunch of good ideas using crafting materials like googly eyes afterwards but the ship had sailed.

## Day 8 - Curve only & Day 9 - Interference Patterns

## Day 10 - Tree
One of the few I was really quite happy with (mostly because the logic built on some code I had written the previous year scanning books and looking at word frequency). It'd be an interesting one to do with more context aware Markov Chains.

## Day 11 - Use something other than a computer as an autonomous process (or non-computer random source) & Day 28 - Use Sound

## Day 12 - Use an API
This is when I started to have a look at p5py, a non-Jython based Processing library, allowing me to properly use external libraries and Python 3 niceness. Unfortunately, its 2D rendering is glacial in comparison, and it feels like there's a memory leak somewhere as well.

I managed to stuff this up the first time around and didn't notice the API I was using only returned the first 100 results if you didn't specify more, meaning I didn't get any data from my own state!

## Day 13 - Do not repeat

## Day 14 - Subdivision

## Day 15 - Let someone else decide the general rules of the piece
## Day 16 - Circles only
## Day 20 - No loops
I wrote a basic drawing program for my eldest (3yo) daughter using p5js on her iPad, and she obligingly drew me a little picture for these topics.

## Day 17 - Draw a line, pick a new colour, move a bit

## Day 18 - One process grows, another process prunes
![img](Day_18/Animated-1.m4v)

## Day 19 - Increase the randomness along the Y-axis
![img](Day_19/Animated-1.m4v)

## Day 21 - function f(x) { DRAW(x); f(x*0.25); f(x*0.5); f(x*0.75); }
And this is where I gave up and went back to Processing's Python mode.
This was based on the work of [Markus Linnenbrink](https://markuslinnenbrink.com/drills/) which looks incredible.

## Day 22 - Draw a line. Wrong answers only.

## Day 23 #264653 #2a9d8f #e9c46a #f4a261 #e76f51, no gradients.

## Day 24 - 500 lines
This is around where I ran out of steam, particularly since I had to go back to work.

## Day 25 - Make a grid of permutations of something

## Days 26 through 31
Not attempted. I took some notes with ideas, but just ran out of time.

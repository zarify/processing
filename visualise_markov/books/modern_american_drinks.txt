MODERN AMERICAN DRINKS.

Absinthe.
Absinthe is composed of the tops and leaves of the herb artemisia
absinthium, or wormwood, which contains a volatile oil, absinthol,
and a yellow, crystalline, resinous compound, called absinthin,
which is the bitter principle. The alcohol with which this is mixed
holds these volatile oils in solution.

The free use of absinthe is injurious. Never serve it in any kind
of drink unless called for by the customer.

California Style Absinthe.
A mixing-glass* half full fine ice, one jigger absinthe. Shake
until very cold, strain into thin bar-glass, fill with siphon
seltzer or carbonic.

* By a mixing-glass is meant a large soda-glass, holding twelve
ounces; it is handier and gives better satisfaction than a goblet.
A jigger is a measure used for measuring liquors when mixing
drinks; it holds two ounces. A pony holds half a jigger.

Dripped Absinthe.
(Use Absinthe Drip-glass.)
Pour one pony of absinthe into the bottom glass, fill the upper
(drip) glass full of ice-water. When two-thirds of the water has
dripped into the absinthe it is ready to be drunk. A few drops of
anisette will improve this drink.

Absinthe, Italian Style.
Put into a thin eight-ounce glass containing a few lumps of clear
ice one pony of absinthe, two dashes maraschino, four dashes
anisette. Slowly fill the glass with ice-water, stir well with long
bar-spoon. Serve.

Absinthe, Swiss Style.
Fill a mixing-glass half-full of fine ice, pour into it one pony of
absinthe, one pony of water, one dash of gum-syrup. Shake with
shaker until very cold, strain into champagne-tumbler, fill up with
siphon seltzer.

Ammonia and Seltzer.
This is a good remedy for the relief of the depression following
alcoholic excesses. Dose: Twenty drops of spirit. ammon. aromat. in
a medium-sized glass of seltzer or plain water.

Ammonia, Soda, and Seltzer.
Same as ammonia and seltzer, mixing a small bar-spoonful of
bicarbonate of soda in the drink before imbibing.

Archbishop.
Dissolve in a mixing-glass one-half tablespoonful fine sugar in a
little water, the juice of quarter of a lemon, fill glass half-full
fine ice, add one jigger port wine, two dashes Jamaica rum. Shake
well. Serve in long thin punch-glass on ice with straws. Trim with
fruit in season.

Arrack.
Arrack is made from the juice obtained from the cocoanut-tree.
There is another kind made from rice. That which is imported from
Japan is considered the best.

Appetizer.
A mixing-glass half-full fine ice; add three dashes absinthe, three
dashes pepsin bitters, one jigger French vermouth. Shake well,
strain, and serve.

Barley Water.
One tablespoonful pearl barley to two quarts water. Put on fire and
boil two minutes; strain through cheesecloth. This makes an
excellent drink if made into lemonade.

Bicarbonate of Soda.
One small bar-spoonful of bicarbonate of soda in a medium-sized
glassful of plain water or seltzer (this is an excellent
stomach-settler).

Black Stripe.
One teaspoonful molasses, one small lump ice, one jigger Jamaica,
Medford, or St. Croix rum. Mix well in small bar-glass. Serve.

Bishop.
A long thin punch-glass half-full fine ice, the juice of quarter of
a lemon, the juice of half an orange, one dash Jamaica rum, two
jiggers Burgundy, one tablespoonful fine sugar. Mix well, fill the
glass with seltzer, ornament with fruit. Serve straws.

Blue Blazer.
One lump of sugar dissolved with a little hot water in a mug; add
one jigger of Scotch whiskey. Ignite this mixture. Take another mug
and pour from one to the other several times, giving it the
appearance of a streak of blue fire. Serve in hot-drink glass. Add
a piece twisted lemon-peel and a little grated nutmeg.

Bosom Caresser.
Fill a mixing-glass one-third full of fine ice; add a teaspoonful
raspberry syrup, one fresh egg, one jigger brandy; fill with milk,
shake well, and strain.

Bracer.
One pony brandy, one-half pony yellow chartreuse, one-half pony
maraschino, five drops absinthe, the yolk of one egg whipped, one
tablespoonful fine sugar. Mix well with ice, strain, and serve in
small fancy glasses.

Brain-Duster.
A mixing-glass half-full of fine ice, two dashes gum syrup, one
pony absinthe, one-half pony Italian vermouth, one-half pony
whiskey. Mix well, strain into thin glass, fill with seltzer.

Brandy and Ginger Ale.
Place a lump of ice in a long thin punch-glass, add one jigger
brandy and a cold bottle of imported ginger ale.

Brandy Champerelle.
Fill a sherry-glass one-fourth full maraschino, one-fourth full
orange curaçoa, one-fourth full yellow chartreuse, and one-fourth
full brandy. Add a few drops of Angostura bitters carefully. Be
sure to keep the different liqueurs from running into one another.

Brandy and Gum.
A few dashes gum-syrup in a whiskey-glass, one lump ice, a small
bar-spoon. Place, with a decanter of brandy, before customer, to
help himself.

Brandy and Soda.
One lump of ice in long punch-glass, one jigger brandy, one bottle
cold soda.

Brandy and Sugar.
One lump of sugar dissolved with a little water in a whiskey-glass,
one lump ice, a small bar-spoon. Place, with a decanter of brandy,
before customer.

Burned Brandy.
(GOOD IN A CASE OF DIARRHŒA.)
Put two lumps of cut-loaf sugar in a dish; add one jigger good
brandy, and ignite. When sufficiently burnt, serve in a
whiskey-glass.

Burned Brandy and Peach.
Prepare same as Burned Brandy. Place two or three slices of dried
peaches in the glass, pour the burned liquid over them, grate a
little nutmeg on top. Serve.

Cincinnati.
A glass half-full of lemon soda; then fill with draught beer.

Cherry Brandy.
Ten pounds of ripe wild cherries are freed from their pits, the
pits are pulverized, and, with the cherries and one gallon brandy,
placed in a demijohn or a covered stone jar for eight weeks. Add
two pounds refined sugar, filter through filtering-paper, bottle;
but use only after it has been bottled at least six weeks.
[TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE: The seeds of some stone fruits such as cherry
contain ‘amygdalin’ which may be toxic.]

Claret Lemonade.
Make a plain, sweet lemonade, add a jigger of claret before
shaking; decorate with fruit. Serve straws.

Mulled Claret.
Put in a dish four lumps sugar, two jiggers claret, the juice of a
quarter of a lemon, a little powdered allspice, three cloves, a
small stick cinnamon. Bring the above to the boiling point, then
strain into a hot-drink glass, and add a slice of lemon.

Mulled Claret and Egg.
Prepare same as Mulled Claret, leaving out the lump sugar. Boil the
mixture one minute. Beat up the yolk of one egg with a small
spoonful of fine sugar. Place the beaten egg in a hot-drink glass
and pour the boiling claret over it, mixing well with spoon; grate
a little nutmeg on top.

Brandy Cobbler.
Fill a thin fizz-glass three-fourths full of fine ice, add three
dashes gum-syrup, three dashes maraschino, one jigger brandy. Mix
well. Trim with fruit in season. Serve with straws.

California Brandy Cobbler.
Prepare same as Brandy Cobbler, using California brandy.

Those with the addition of the whites of eggs are called sherbets.

Sherbets which are of a smooth, fine texture, but only half frozen,

Water ices only half frozen, without stirring, and having a rough,
icy texture, are called granites.

Frozen punches are made by adding liquor to the ices either before

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
